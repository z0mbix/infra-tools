# infra-tools

## Description

This repo contains some useful code to help get your infrastructure up and running with
some Packer to build a base AMI on AWS, some Ansible and soon some Terraform.

## Testing

If you have vagrant and virtualbox available, you can easily test this with:

```shell
vagrant up
```

The vagrant image is the Rocky Linux 9 bento box from <https://app.vagrantup.com/bento/boxes/rockylinux-9>
